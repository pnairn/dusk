You have a world with towns and dungeons. Towns have a finite number of people who can fight the darkness.  Character creation is selecting one. Once there is no people left, you lose that world and need to regen another.

Your adventurer learns a new fact about a species each time he kills one. They are written into a bestiary.  Every new fact gives 1 xp.  Once you learn everything about a monster you can no longer grind them.

If you make it back to town, you can leave a copy of your bestiary for future adventurers. (Maybe they retire and become teachers, avoids regrind)
